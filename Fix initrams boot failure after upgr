had some trouble with Debian and Ubuntu VPSs. apt upgrades don't play well with MSP bootloaders.

this fix is for when apt-get upgrade spits this out:

      I: The initramfs will attempt to resume from /dev/sda2
      I:     UUID=948396b3-f329-4b5a-9771-1464ff25eca9
      I: Set the RESUME variable to override this.

$ sudo blkid | awk -F\" '/swap/ {print $2}'
$ sudo printf "RESUME=UUID=$(blkid | awk -F\" '/swap/ {print $2}')\n" | sudo tee /etc/initramfs-tools/conf.d/resume
$ sudo update-initramfs -u -k all

# or

# boot from LiveCD or repair
$ sudo fdisk -l   #to find boot disk marked with*
$ sudo fsck /dev/vda1    #disk with boot record
